5</span>THE VERNER RAVEN</h2>
<p>The Raven he flies in the evening tide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He in day dares not intrude;<br />
Whoever is born to have evil luck<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In vain may seek for good.</p>
<p>Lustily flies the Verner Raven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; High o&rsquo;er the wall he&rsquo;s flown,<br />
For he was aware that Irmindlin fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sate in her bower alone.</p>
<p>He southward flew, and he northward flew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He flew high up in the cloud;<br />
And he beheld May Irmindlin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who sorrowing sate and sew&rsquo;d.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>&ldquo;Now hear me, little Irmindlin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why weep in this piteous way?<br />
For father or mother, or is it for brother,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That adown thy cheek tears stray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Damsel Irmindlin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Swift out of the window looked she:<br />
&ldquo;O who is he that will comfort me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And list to my misery?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear thou, wild Raven, bird of Death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fly thou hither down to me;<br />
And all my trouble and all my care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll straight relate to thee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father gave me the son of a king,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We were fitted the one for the other,<br />
But he was into the Austrian land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dispatched by my cruel step-mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So happily we should together have lived,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For he my whole love won;<br />
But she wished to give me her sister&rsquo;s son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who was liker a fiend than a man.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;I had a gallant brother once,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Verner by name was he,<br />
But he was transformed by my cruel step-dame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And driven to a strange countrie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear thou, Damsel Irmindlin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What wilt thou give me, say?<br />
I&rsquo;ll carry thee straight to thy plighted youth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If with me thou wilt fly away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt from me the ruddy gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the silver white receive;<br />
If thou bear me to my Bridegroom bold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And me from my woe relieve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep thou thyself thy silver and gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such gifts I do not crave;<br />
The first son thou conceivest of him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That, that from thee I&rsquo;ll have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then straight she took the Raven&rsquo;s foot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Laid that her white hand upon;<br />
She swore to him by her Christian faith,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he should have the son.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Then took he Damsel Irmindlin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He placed her on his back;<br />
Then flew he over the wild sea waves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As fast as he could track.</p>
<p>It was the Verner Raven wild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the turret he alighted:<br />
&ldquo;Now sit we, Damsel, upon the house,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where dwells thy Bridegroom plighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out came bold Sir Nilaus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A silver cup in his hand:<br />
&ldquo;Be welcome, Damsel Irmindlin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here to this foreign land!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I give to thee, Raven wild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That hast brought to me my Bride?<br />
No better tidings I have heard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since from Denmark forth I hied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanks be to brave Sir Nilaus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He kept his faith so well;<br />
The Monday next that followed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His bridal it befell.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>They their bridal solemnised<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With glee and utmost joy;<br />
When forty weeks away had flown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She brought into the world a boy.</p>
<p>It was the Verner Raven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Perched on the turret tall:<br />
&ldquo;What thou did&rsquo;st promise me, Irmindlin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To thy mind I&rsquo;d have thee call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So sorely she wept, and her hands she smote,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because it a girl was not:<br />
&ldquo;Thee shall the wild Death Raven have,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That will cost thee thy life, I wot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came flying over the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Raven, with looks to scare;<br />
So sorely then wept both Maidens and Dames,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And their hands wrung in despair.</p>
<p>Sir Nilaus went, and proffered the bird<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Proud castles many a one;<br />
He proffered him even the half of his land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If he only might keep his son.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;If I get not the little babe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou sorely shall rue it straight,<br />
Thee I limb from limb will tear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy kingdom devastate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She has taken the babe, and in linen white<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath wrapped it tenderly;<br />
&ldquo;Farewell, farewell, my dearest son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou owest thy death to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then bore they out the little babe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On its mother&rsquo;s breast that lay;<br />
O&rsquo;er the cheeks of all did big tears fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such woe was and wail that day.</p>
<p>The Raven took the child in his claw,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He croaked in joyous guise;<br />
Sir Nilaus stood and looked thereon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pouring forth bitter sighs.</p>
<p>Then tore he amain its right eye out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drank the half of its heart&rsquo;s red blood;<br />
Then he became the handsomest knight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That upon earth e&rsquo;er stood.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>He changed into the loveliest knight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That with eye man ever had seen:<br />
It was Irmindlin&rsquo;s brother himself,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who had long enchanted been.</p>
<p>All the folk that stood thereby,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They fell upon their knees bare;<br />
And the child it was to life restored<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When to God they had made their prayer.</p>
<p>Now sitteth Dame Irmindlin so glad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All her grief has from her hied;<br />
For she has now both brother and son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sleeps by Sir Nilaus&rsquo; side.</p>

12</span>THE COUNT OF VENDEL&rsquo;S<br />
DAUGHTER</h2>
<p>Within a bower the womb I left,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Midst dames and maids who stood to aid;<br />
They wrapped me first in silken weft,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And next in scarlet red array&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>But a stepdame soon &rsquo;twas my lot to get,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fierce and wild she proved to me;<br />
Within a coffer me she set,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pushed it out upon the sea.</p>
<p>By one wave I was borne to land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And by the next away was ta&rsquo;en;<br />
But God on High, it seems, had plann&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I should footing there obtain.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>The tide it drove me to the shore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in its backward course retook;<br />
Sure ne&rsquo;er had child of king before<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such buffeting on sea to brook.</p>
<p>But God He help&rsquo;d me, so that I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was cast above the billows&rsquo; reach;<br />
And soon a savage wolf drew nigh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was prowling on the sandy beach.</p>
<p>Soon prowling came a wolf so gray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And me up-taking in his jaws,<br />
He carried me with care away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep, deep into the forest shaws.</p>
<p>That self-same wolf he was so kind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That me beneath a tree he laid;<br />
And then came running a nimble hind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And me unto its lair convey&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>There me for winter one she nurs&rsquo;d&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She nursed me for two winters&rsquo; space.<br />
To creep, to creep, I learnt at first,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And next I learnt to pace, to pace.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>And I was full eight years, I wot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the quiet, green retreat.<br />
Close couched beside the hind I got<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full many a slumber calm and sweet.</p>
<p>I had clothes and shelter of no kind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Except the linden green alone;<br />
And, save the gentle forest hind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had nurse and foster-mother none.</p>
<p>But forth on courser reeking hot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There rushed a knight of bearing bold,<br />
And he my foster-mother shot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With arrow on the verdant wold.</p>
<p>He pierced the hind with mortal wound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all our fond connection cut;<br />
Then wrapped his cloak my frame around,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And me within his buckler put.</p>
<p>That self-same knight, so bold and strong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within his bower the foundling bred;<br />
He tended me both well and long,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And finally his bride he made.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>He had by long inquiry found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My father was a noble count<br />
In Vendel&rsquo;s land, who castles own&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And rul&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er many a plain and
mount.</p>
<p>The first night we together slept<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was fraught with woe of darkest hue;<br />
Foes, whom he long at bay had kept,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Broke in on us, and him they slew.</p>
<p>The night we lay together first<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A deed of horror was fulfill&rsquo;d;<br />
The bride-house door his foemen burst,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in my arms my husband kill&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Soon, soon, my friends to counsel go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A husband new they chose for me;<br />
The cloister&rsquo;s prior of mitred brow&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The good Sir Nilaus styl&rsquo;d was he.</p>
<p>But soon as I the threshold cross&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The nuns could not their fury smother;<br />
They vow&rsquo;d by God and all His Host,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Prior Nilaus was my brother.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Forth from the cloister him they drew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They pelted him to death with stones;<br />
I stood close by, and all could view,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I scarce could hear his piteous moans.</p>
<p>Once more my friends to counsel hied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For me another spouse they get&mdash;<br />
Son of the King of England wide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was he, and hight Sir Engelbret.</p>
<p>Nine winters with that princely youth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived; of joy we had no dearth,<br />
I tell to ye, for sooth and truth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To ten fair sons that I gave birth.</p>
<p>But pirate crews the land beset,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No one, no one, my grief could tell;<br />
They slew with sword Sir Engelbret,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And nine of my fair sons as well.</p>
<p>My husband and my sons with brand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They slew.&nbsp; How I bewail their case!<br />
My tenth son here they from the land&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I never more shall see his face.</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Now is my care as complicate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As golden threads which maidens spin;<br />
God crown with bliss Sir Engelbret,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He ever was so free from sin.</p>
<p>But now I&rsquo;ll take the holy vows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the cloister under Ey;<br />
I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er become another&rsquo;s spouse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But in religion I will die.</p>
<p>But first to all the country side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I will declare my bosom&rsquo;s grief;<br />
I find, the more my grief I hide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The less, the less, is my relief.</p>
<h2><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>THE CRUEL MOTHER-IN-LAW</h2>
<p>From his home and his country Sir Volmor should fare,<br />
His wife he commends to his mother&rsquo;s best care.</p>
<p>Proud Lyborg she sang, as the dancers she watched,<br />
Behind stood Dame Ingeborg, malice she hatched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To live to the Fall if the luck I enjoy<br />
Fair lady, thy beautiful voice I&rsquo;ll destroy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proud Lyborg&rsquo;s fair maidens upon the floor sprang,<br />
And all through the evening she unto them sang.</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>But alack two short summer days scarcely had
pass&rsquo;d,<br />
When in desperate sickness proud Lyborg lay fast.</p>
<p>Proud Lyborg fell sick, and lay stretched on her bed,<br />
Then backwards and forwards Dame Ingeborg sped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hear me, Dame Ingeborg, dear mother mine,<br />
Do bring me, I pray, either water or wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water is frozen, and frozen the wine,<br />
And frozen the tap in each barrel of mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door it is locked, and the keys are away,<br />
But where, daughter dear, by the Saints I can&rsquo;t
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can nor water nor wine from thee win,<br />
Then open the door that the dew may rush in.</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;Cause the door to the North to be wide open
set,<br />
Then my feverish frame cool refreshment shall get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door to the South I&rsquo;ll have straightway
undone,<br />
That the hot sun may flash in thy visage upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O would there were one that for sweet pity&rsquo;s
sake,<br />
To my mother a message in secret would take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answer&rsquo;d proud Lyborg&rsquo;s own little
foot-boy:<br />
&ldquo;Your message in secret I&rsquo;ll carry with
joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That they were alone they with confidence thought;<br />
Dame Ingeborg stood nigh, and every word caught.</p>
<p>The lad he upsprang on his courser so high,<br />
He galloped as fast as the wing&egrave;d birds fly.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>In, in came the lad, in a kirtle red drest:<br />
&ldquo;Your daughter, Dame Lyborg, in death will soon rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She bids you to come with all possible quickness,<br />
To live through this night she can&rsquo;t hope from her
sickness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Straight unto her servants proud Mettelil says:<br />
&ldquo;My horses go fetch from the meads where they
graze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horses they galloped, the chariot wheels turned,<br />
Throughout the long day whilst the summer heat burned.</p>
<p>The midsummer&rsquo;s sun with such fury it glows<br />
Proud Lyborg swoons &rsquo;neath it in terrible throes.</p>
<p>A purse takes Dame Ingeborg fraught with gold treasure,<br />
And she speeds to the hall, her heart bounding with pleasure.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&ldquo;Whosoever will gold and will bounty derive,<br />
Let him help me to bury proud Lyborg alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon as she of the gold distribution had made,<br />
Below the black earth the fair lily they laid.</p>
<p>To the gate of the castle proud Mettelil came,<br />
Dame Ingeborg stood there, and leaned on the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proud Ingeborg, hear what I say unto thee:<br />
What hast done with my daughter? declare that to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yesterday &rsquo;twas that with sorrowful mind,<br
/>
Her corse to the arms of the grave we consign&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proud Ingeborg, hush thee, nor talk in this guise,<br
/>
But show me the grave where my dear daughter lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Dame Mettelil o&rsquo;er the place trod,<br />
Proud Lyborg she screamed underneath the green sod.</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;Whoever will gold and will silver obtain,<br />
Let him help me to dig now with might and with main.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took up proud Lyborg, all there as she lay,<br />
Her mother flung o&rsquo;er her the scarlet array.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell to me, Lyborg, thou child of my heart,<br />
Since restored to the arms of thy mother thou art,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What death to thy thinking should Ingeborg thole,<br />
For placing thee living in horrid grave-hole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To destroy my young life it is true, she was bent,<br
/>
But let her live, mother, and let her repent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she go unpunished I cannot permit,<br />
I&rsquo;ll teach her what &rsquo;tis on a fire to sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To two of her servants proud Mettelil spake:<br />
&ldquo;Do ye quickly a fire on the open field make.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;Do ye cut down the oak and the bonny ash-tree,<br
/>
That the fire by them fed may burn brilliant and free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dame Ingeborg forth from the house they convey&rsquo;d,<br />
And they burnt her to dust on the fire they had made.</p>
<p>Sir Volmor came home from the red field of strife,<br />
Then tidings assailed him, with dolour so rife.</p>
<p>Then tidings assailed him, with dolour so rife,<br />
Burnt, burnt was his mother, and flown was his wife.</p>
<p>He bade for proud Lyborg of red gold a store,<br />
But he could the lily obtain nevermore.</p>

25</span>THE FAITHFUL KING OF THULE</h2>
<p>A king so true and steady<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Thule lived of old;<br />
To him his dying lady<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A goblet gave of gold.</p>
<p>He drank thereout so often,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For all his love it gained;<br />
To tears his eyes would soften<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whene&rsquo;er its juice he drained.</p>
<p>When death drew nigh, his spirit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His riches o&rsquo;er he told<br />
To him who should inherit&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But not that cup of gold.</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>By all his knights surrounded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One day he sat at dine,<br />
In hall of fortress, founded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By ocean&rsquo;s roaring brine.</p>
<p>The ancient hero rallies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With one more draught his blood,<br />
Then casts the sacred chalice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Below him in the flood.</p>
<p>Deep, deep within the billows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He watched it as it sank;<br />
Then, sinking on his pillows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No drop more e&rsquo;er he drank.</p>

27</span>THE FAIRIES&rsquo; SONG</h2>
<p>Balmy the evening air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nature, how bright the hue!<br />
But, though the bloom is fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sense with sweets to woo,<br />
Love, Music, Mirth, Oh give!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On these we Fairies live!</p>
<p>The glow-worm&rsquo;s amorous lamp<br />

Then, Spirits, hither fly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And match their revelry!</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; And Gnats, what reels they run!<br />
In wide or narrow ring,<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
